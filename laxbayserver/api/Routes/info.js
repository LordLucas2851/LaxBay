" The founder of the store is Lucas Shaver and was originally created at his college Lander University. The store is an online only store for right now with hopes to open in-person stores in the near future. We offer a place for users to create posts for their gear/memorabilia they are hoping to sell, as well as a search engine for users looking to find some new gear or items for themselves. You can search for items based on the type of gear and the search engine will provide some recommendations of post based on the users filters. We allow new and slightly used gear/memorabilia to be posted and any posts that don't fit our standards will be removed."
